      <h1>Graduate Requirements</h1>

      <p>
        At University Of Ghana, we have specific requirements that students must
        fulfill in order to graduate from their respective programs. The
        following are the general guidelines:
      </p>

      <h2>Academic Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        Students must successfully complete the required number of credits for
        their chosen program. This includes both core and elective courses.
      </p>

      <h2>GPA (Grade Point Average)</h2>
      <p>
        A minimum GPA of 3.5 is required for graduation. The exact GPA
        requirement may vary by program, so it's essential for students to check
        the specific requirements for their Program.
      </p>

      <h2>Program-Specific Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        Some programs have specific requirements that students must meet. This
        may include internships, capstone projects, or other hands-on
        experiences relevant to the Academic Program
      </p>

      <h2>Elective Courses</h2>
      <p>
        Students may have the option to choose elective courses within certain
        parameters. The fulfillment of elective requirements depends on the
        program and is often designed to allow students to explore areas of
        interest.
      </p>

      <h2>Residency Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        Certain programs may have residency requirements, a minimum of 150
        credits must be completed at our institution for graduation.
      </p>

      <h2>Application for Graduation</h2>
      <p>
        Students must submit a formal application for graduation by a specified
        deadline. This initiates the graduation process and ensures that all
        requirements are met.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's important for students to consult with their academic advisors
        regularly to ensure they are on track to meet these requirements and to
        address any questions or concerns they may have.
