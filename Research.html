            <p class="Res-p2">In a recent publication from our Computer Science Department, researchers delved into the application of machine learning to enhance cybersecurity measures. The department dedicated a case study to a group of students to use a Deep learning network to detect anomalies. They achieved excellent results in supervised network intrusion detection. They also showed that using only the first three octets of IP addresses can be efficient in handling the use of dynamic IP addresses, representing the strangeness of DNN in the attendance of DHCP. This approach showed that autoencoders could be used to detect anomalies wherever they trained on expected flows.
              <br>They proposed Recurrent Neural Network RNN and Deep Neural Network DNN with ML techniques related to anomaly detection in the network. They also conducted local experiments showing the feasibility of the DNN approach to network flow traffic analysis. <img class="Res-img1" src="img/ml.png" >This survey also investigated DNN models’ effectiveness in network flow traffic analysis by introducing the conducting experiments with their FCN model. This approach shows encouraging results with enhanced accuracy in detecting anomalies compared to the conventional techniques of ML such as SVM, random forest, and Ad boosting.<br>They presented a hybrid data processing model for detecting anomalies in the network that influences the optimization and Convolution Neural Network CNN. Improvements in the GWO and CNN training approaches improved with exploration and initial population capture capabilities and restored failure functionality. These extended alternatives are mentioned as Improved-GWO and Improved CNN. The proposed model runs in two stages for the detection anomaly in the network. In the first stage, improved GWO was utilized for feature selection to attain an ideal trade-off among two objectives to reduce the frailer rate and minimize the feature set. In the second stage, improved CNN was utilized for the classification of network anomalies. The author said that the proposed model’s efficiency is evaluated with a benchmark (DARPA’98 and KDD’99) and artificial datasets. They showed the results obtained, which validate that the proposed cloud-based anomaly detection model was superior to the other related works utilized for anomaly detection in the network, accuracy, detection rate, false-positive rate, and F-score. The proposed model shows an overall enhancement of 8.25%, 4.08%, and 3.62% in detection rate, false positives, and accuracy, respectively, related to standard GWO with CNN.
